# Authentication Fix Summary

The following changes were made to fix the authentication issue:

1. Updated the SupabaseAuthProvider.tsx to use the shared Supabase client from lib/supabase.ts instead of creating a new one with hardcoded credentials.

2. Updated lib/supabase.ts to use hardcoded credentials instead of environment variables, since we couldn't create environment files directly.

These changes ensure that both authentication providers are using the same Supabase client instance with the same credentials, which should resolve the "No auth user data available" error.

To test the fix:
1. Restart your development server
2. Try logging in again
3. The app should now be able to create threads and function properly

For production deployment, it's recommended to:
1. Create proper environment variables (.env.local file) with these credentials
2. Update lib/supabase.ts to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values

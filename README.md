## üîê Authentication Setup

Chat0 uses Convex for user authentication:

1. Register a new account on the app's login page
2. Your credentials are securely stored in the Convex database
3. All your chat data is linked to your user account

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure

The Convex backend uses the following tables:
- `users`: User accounts with email and password
- `threads`: Chat threads linked to users
- `messages`: Individual messages in threads
- `messageSummaries`: Summaries of messages for navigation

To use AI models, you'll need to:
1. Go to the Settings page after logging in
2. Add your API keys for the models you want to use:
   - OpenAI API key
   - Google Gemini API key
   - OpenRouter API key (for other models)
3. Your API keys are stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers
